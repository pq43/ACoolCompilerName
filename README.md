An object-oriented, general-purpose programming language that supports mathematical algebraic expressions (algebraic expressions, integrals, derivatives), written in C. Includes a Pratt operator-precedence parser, bytecode assembler, bytecode virtual machine, bytecode disassembler, and a read-eval-print-loop.

## Licensing

This uses the MIT License and follows Robert Nystrom's Clox implementation from his book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's an absolutely amazing book that has taught me almost everything I know about compilers today.
